This is a simple banking management application that reads the accounts and transactions from a csv text file, creates the objects from the respective values, and tracks every transaction for each account, also denies transactions not supported by the account.
Displays every transaction on console and also displays the transactions made by an account of our choice.
This application helped me strengthen my core java skills.
